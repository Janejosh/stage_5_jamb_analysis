# 📊 JAMB Exam Performance Analysis & Prediction (2020–2030)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project investigates the increasing rate of failure in the Nigerian Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) exams. By analyzing real survey data collected from past candidates (2020–2025), we explore the root causes of exam failure and use predictive modeling to forecast future performance trends from 2026 to 2030.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify key factors contributing to JAMB exam failures.
- Predict exam outcomes based on socioeconomic and academic inputs.
- Provide data-backed recommendations for students, educators, and policymakers.

## 🧠 Key Insights from Data
- Students studying **1–3 hours/day** showed the highest pass rates.
- Use of **Mobile/Web Apps** led to better exam performance than self-study alone.
- **Middle and high-income families** had more successful candidates.
- Students with **both parents present** performed better than those under guardianship.
- High-rated **CBT centers** strongly correlated with better outcomes.

---

## 🤖 Predictive Modeling
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression
- **Target Variable:** Exam Outcome (Pass/Fail)
- **Accuracy Achieved:** 94%
- **Forecast:** Gradual improvement in performance expected through 2030 if insights are applied.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and modeling
- **Google Forms & Excel** for survey design and raw data collection
- **MS Word / PowerPoint** for documentation and reporting

---

## 🧩 Challenges Faced
- Collecting survey responses was time-consuming and required repeated outreach.
- Predictive modeling introduced encoding and syntax errors that required significant debugging.
- Feature engineering and selecting the right variables for training required multiple iterations.
